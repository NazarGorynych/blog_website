# blog_website

This is a blog-website created on Django framework. This project represents my skills and abilities working in web-development. 
I created this website on my own, without any external helping hand from a mentor or anybody else.
My aim was to set my knowledge of Django basics in stone and it has worked quite well. 
This website can be transformed into commercial one and be distributed on the internet.
