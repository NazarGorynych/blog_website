# blog_website

This is a blog-website created on Django framework. This project represents my skills and abilities in web-development. 
I created this website on my own, without any external help from a mentor or anybody else.(besides google and documentation)
My aim was to set in stone my knowledge of Django basics and it has worked quite well.
